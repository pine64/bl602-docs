Usage as advanced ttl adapter
===========

Overview (Work in progress)
--------

To replace my typical used usb-ttl adapter my idea is to switch to the bl602 and use it for regular work.
The first additional functionality i cant have with typical usb-ttl adapter is running scripted TTL commands on bl602 connected to a usb-powerbank and use the LED for confirmation if the response was ok or not. Also save the response on the bl602 internal memory for later review.
