Hardware Notes
==============

This file contains a compilation of various pieces of information about the
BL602's hardware (e.g. core, peripherals, debug, memory map), gathered from
the SDK repository and around the internet. This is the best we can do in lieu
of a proper Technical Reference Manual, which has not yet been released as of
this writing.

Contributions welcome!

CPU Core
--------
According to [soc602_reg.svd][2], the BL602 contains a RISC-V RV32IMAFC core.
Interestingly, the [datasheet][1] and online spec sheets from Bouffalo Lab
never mention RISC-V, simply calling the core a "32-bit RISC CPU."

CNX Software [claims][5] that the core is a [SiFive E24][6]. Although this
claim is unsourced, information in the datasheet seems to corroborate it. The
datasheet claims that the CPU achieves a Dhrystone score of 1.46 DMIPS/MHz and
a CoreMark score of 3.1 CoreMark/MHz. These numbers exactly match what SiFive
advertises for the E24. Similarly, the set of RISC-V extensions matches, as
does the pipeline length (3-stage) and number of breakpoints/watchpoints (4).

The BL602 appears to diverge from the reference E24 implementation in its
memory map, however: its peripherals are mapped starting at `0x4000_0000`,
whereas SiFive's [E24 Manual][7] has a memory map placing peripherals at
`0x2000_0000`. Likewise, the BL602 maps its memories at `0x2000_0000` but the
E24 reference design maps them at `0x6000_0000`. Finally, the BL602's TCMs are
differently-mapped, differently-named (TCM vs TIM), and differently-sized
(48KiB vs 32KiB) from the reference E24 ones. SiFive does claim that the memory
map and TIM sizes are customizable, though, so none of these differences are
strong evidence against the core being an E24.

[clic.h][4], which is part of the BL602's register definition headers, appears
to be a SiFive-authored file (see the include guard), and its addresses match
the E24 reference. I think this is one of the clearest pieces of evidence for
the core being SiFive IP.

Memory Map
----------
The [datasheet][1] contains a memory map, as does [soc602_reg.svd][2] and
[bl602.h][3]. As mentioned above, [clic.h][4] also contains part of the map. I
have attempted to synthesize information from all these sources into a single
unified table. I make no guarantees to the accuracy of this table.

| `0x4202_0000` | `0x4203_BFFF` |  Wireless RAM (datasheet disagrees on base)|

(Peripherals in *`italics`* are present in the SVD but not the datasheet.)

The datasheet claims that the system has 276KiB of RAM, and indeed that is the
number we get by adding up 64KiB of main RAM, 112KiB of wireless RAM, 48KiB of
instruction TCM, 48KiB of data TCM, and 4KiB of deep sleep retention RAM.

As noted in the table, the wireless RAM address is ambiguous. bl602.h says it's
`0x4202_0000`, but the datasheet says it's `0x4203_0000`. I can only assume one
of them is a typo, and my guess is that it's the one that isn't code.

Interestingly, bl602.h defines three extra "remap" mappings, labeled REMAP0,
REMAP1, and REMAP2, in addition to the ranges in the table above for each of
flash XIP, wireless RAM, and the TCMs. I have not found any register that looks
like a remapping control, so I'm not sure what this is about. The remap base
addresses are as follows:

| Memory | "Normal" base | REMAP0 base   | REMAP1 base   | REMAP2 base   |
|--------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| XIP    | `0x2300_0000` | `0x3300_0000` | `0x4300_0000` | `0x5300_0000` |
| WRAM   | `0x4202_0000` | `0x2202_0000` | `0x3202_0000` | `0x5202_0000` |
| TCM    | `0x2200_8000` | `0x3200_8000` | `0x4200_8000` | `0x5200_8000` |

On-chip ROM
-----------
The BL602 has 128KiB of "ROM," mapped at `0x2100_0000`. As far as I can tell,
this is an actual Mask ROM that's hardwired at the factory, not a flash or an
EEPROM. What immutable data could take up 128KiB? Code, it appears! In the
[OpenOCD configuration][8] for the BL602, `pc` is forced to the start of the
ROM after reset. Therefore, it seems likely that the beginning of the ROM holds
a BootROM which implements the various boot modes ("UART, SDIO, and Flash")
listed in the datasheet.

But that's not all that's in the ROM. There's an interesting peripheral driver
called [RomDriver][9], which exposes a number of functions for global register
configuration, power+clock+sleep management, serial flash setup, and general
operations like delay and memcpy. However, none of the functions are actually
implemented by the driver! Instead, it forwards each call to a corresponding
function pointer in a table at `0x2101_0800`, which is within the ROM. I assume
the function pointers in that table are also ROM addresses, meaning the bulk
of the ROM is likely taken up by library code. The SDK has a macro called
`BL602_USE_ROM_DRIVER` which selects whether to use the ROM implementation of
functions when available.

Registers in the TZ ("trust isolation") peripherals reference a ROM (for
example, `tzc_rom0_r0_lock`). This could indicate that areas of the ROM need
protection from unauthorized reads. Perhaps the ROM holds factory-provisioned,
per-device keys that are used as part of the secure boot flow? This, however,
is purely speculation.

Here are the known areas of the ROM's memory map:

| Base address  | Top address   |  Name                                      |
|---------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `0x2100_0000` | `0x2101_07FF` |  BootROM (+ other stuff?)                  |
| `0x2101_0800` | `0x2101_0FFF` |  RomDriver function table                  |
| `0x2101_1000` | `0x2101_FFFF` |  RomDriver functions (+ other stuff?)      |
