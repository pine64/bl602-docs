BL602 Documentation
====================

Hardware
--------
- [BL602/604 Datasheet](mirrored/BL602_BL604_DS_Datasheet.pdf)
  (34 pages): Includes pinout, memory map, and general peripheral descriptions
  but no detailed functional specification or register listings. Sipeed, a board
  vendor that plans to use the BL602, [claims](https://twitter.com/SipeedIO/status/1321658609990725633)
  that full register documentation will be available sometime in November 2020.
- [soc602_reg.svd][1]: Contains a seemingly-complete register listing, with
  names but no descriptions, for the BL602.
- [Hardware Notes](hardware_notes): Additional information
  gathered from the SDK repository and elsewhere on the internet.
